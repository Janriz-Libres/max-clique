# Shah's Random Heuristic for Maximum Clique Problem

This project provides a Java reimplementation of Shah's Random Heuristic algorithm for solving the Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). Shah's algorithm, originally implemented in C++, is a heuristic approach to finding the largest subset of vertices in a graph such that every pair of vertices in the subset is connected by an edge.

## Algorithm Description
Shah's Random Heuristic is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in finding a maximum clique in a graph. The algorithm iteratively adds vertices to the current clique, chosen randomly from the set of vertices that can potentially expand the current clique size.

## Usage
To use this implementation:
- Clone the repository.
- Compile and run the Java code using your preferred Java compiler or environment.

## Implementation Details
- Language: Java
- Algorithm: Shah's Random Heuristic (reimplemented from C++)
